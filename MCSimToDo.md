1. Add a line checking for any absorbing states in the transition matrix.

2. Add a check after each step to make sure not in an absorbing state. If in an absorbing state, break for loop.

3. Create a new function that repeats MCSim a set number of times and allows us to find hitting probability over a large sample.
