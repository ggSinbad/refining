~~1. Add a line checking for any absorbing states in the transition matrix.~~

~~2. Add a check after each step to make sure not in an absorbing state. If in an absorbing state, break for loop.~~

~~3. Create a new function that repeats MCSim a set number of times and allows us to find hitting probability over a large sample.~~

4. Check hitting probabilities against the analytical approach to ensure the results are correct.

5. Calculate mean first passage times (hitting times)
