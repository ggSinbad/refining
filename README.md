Probability of success when overrefining gear on EinherjarRO with expected materials cost.


The code computes the probability of reaching any refine level given a starting point. This provides probability tables for refining weapons of all levels as well as armours.

The calculations are run twice, once with normal ores and secondly with enriched ori/elu.


I've also computed the expected oridecon/elunium cost to reach a given refine level.
